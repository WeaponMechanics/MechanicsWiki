# Examples

We get it, Mechanics are complicated. That's why on _every wiki page,_ we added multiple examples explaining how each mechanic, targeter, and conditions works. If you ever feel like you need help, please scroll to the bottom of the page to view samples.

But where else can you find examples[^1]?

* [WeaponMechanics Default Weapons](https://github.com/WeaponMechanics/MechanicsMain/tree/master/WeaponMechanics/src/main/resources/WeaponMechanics/weapons)
  * Click on the folders and explore the files.
  * In each file, you can see how we use mechanics to play sounds.
* [ArmorMechanics Default Armor Abilities](https://github.com/WeaponMechanics/ArmorMechanics/blob/master/src/main/resources/ArmorMechanics/Set.yml)
  * We use titles and potion effects to customize our armor sets.

I also highly recommend you watch our Mechanics tutorial, which gives you a casual approach on how to use Mechanics with WeaponMechanics:
