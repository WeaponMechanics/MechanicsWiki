# Target

Sometimes, a mechanic may target a specific entity or location. For example, for WeaponMechanics explosions, `@Target{}` will target the center of the explosion.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you see the message:

> Not targeting either entity nor location

Then that means you used `@Target{}` when the mechanics do not have any specific target. Not all mechanics have a target.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
